== Description ==

This plugin is a service of [Data443.com](https://www.data443.com).

Data443 is a Data Security and Compliance company traded on the OTCMarkets as [ATDS](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/ATDS/overview).  We have been providing leading GDPR compliance products such as [ClassiDocs](https://www.data443.com/classidocs-home/), Blockchain privacy, and enterprise cloud eDiscovery tools.

The GDPR regulation is a large and complex law.  Each member country is to ratify it into its own legislation and language.  This makes it cumbersome to manage - but rest assured - we have a full [Site Owners Guide](https://www.data443.com/wordpress-site-owners-guide-to-gdpr/) to help you learn and understand some of your requirements.

This product gives a simple and elegant interface to handle Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Help, the identification emails are not sent! =
The GDPR Framework uses the exact same mechanism for sending emails as the rest of your WordPress site. Please test if your site sends out emails at all using the Forgot Password form, for example.
If you get the forgot password email but not the identification email, please make a post in the support forums.

= Help, the link in the identification email doesn't work! =
Are you using SendGrid or another email delivery service? This might corrupt the link in the email.
In case you're using SendGrid, make sure to turn off "click tracking". Otherwise, please post in the support forum!

= Help, the Privacy Tools page acts weirdly or always displays the "link expired" message! =
Check if you're using any caching plugins. If yes, then make sure the Privacy Tools page is excluded.
Also check if a server side cache is enabled by your web host.

= How is this plugin different from the tools in WordPress v4.9.6? =
WordPress 4.9.6 provides tools to allow administrators to manually handle GDPR requests. However, the GDPR framework allows visitors to automatically download and export data to reduce administrative work load.
In addition to that, we provide tools to manage and track custom consent types and also a privacy policy generator.
We are also planning to add other important privacy-related features missing from WordPress core over time.
